In this module I explore the intricacies of loops in Python! I learn how to use while loops to continuously execute code, as well as how to identify infinite 
loop errors and how to fix them. You'll also learn to use for loops to iterate over data, and how to use the range() function with for loops. 
I also explore common errors when using for loops and how to fix them.
Learning Objectives
Implement while loops to continuously execute code
Identify and fix infinite loops when using while loops
Utilize for loops to iterate over sets of data
Use the range() function to control for loops
