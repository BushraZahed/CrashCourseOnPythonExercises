# CrashCourseOnPythonExercises
I finished this online non-credit course authorized by Google and offered through Coursera. This course is designed to teach the foundations of writing simple Python programs using the most common structures. The skills gained include essential Python Data Structures (List, String, Dictionary, etc), fundamental Programming Concepts, basic Python Syntax, Python Programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) . The repo contains all the exercises solved during the course work.   ref:  https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course?specialization=google-it-automation
