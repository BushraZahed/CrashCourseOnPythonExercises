Final project included

Here I apply a problem-solving framework to tackle a challenging final project: implementing a script that generates a "word cloud" from some text.
Learning Objectives
Tackle more complex problems from the ground up using a framework
Formulate a problem statement to understand the inputs and outputs of a script
Conduct research into options for tackling the problem
Plan an approach to solving the problem
Write a complex script in order to implement a solution
