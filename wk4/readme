In this module I dive into more advanced ways to manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and advanced formatting. 
I also explore the more advanced data types: lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
I learn to store, reference, and manipulate data in these structures, as well as combine them to store complex data structures.
Learning Objectives
Manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and formatting
Use lists and tuples to store, reference, and manipulate data
Leverage dictionaries to store more complex data, reference data by keys, and manipulate data stored
Combine these data types to construct complex data structures
